## Implement Light and Dark Mode - 2026-01-26 12:13

- **Add light and dark mode support for web app and future mobile** - Implement comprehensive theming system with light/dark mode toggle. **Problem:** Calculator currently lacks dark mode support, which is needed for better user experience and will be required for mobile apps. The plan includes dark mode for Phase 2.7 and mobile apps use NativeWind which requires dark mode configuration. **Files:** `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` (root layout for theme provider), `apps/web/components/calculator/step5-results.tsx:1-428` (all tabs use dark mode classes but theme switching not implemented), `tailwind.config.js` (dark mode configuration), `apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx` (future mobile implementation). **Solution:** Add next-themes provider to web app layout, implement theme toggle component in header, verify all components support dark mode classes (already implemented throughout calculator components), test on mobile viewport, document dark mode usage for mobile app implementation.

## Add Zip Code Field to Property Details - 2026-01-26 12:14

- **Add zip code input field to Step 1 Property Details form** - Add zip code field for property location. **Problem:** Property address is captured but zip code is missing, which is needed for future features like market data lookup, property tax estimates, and geographic analysis. The database schema includes an address field but no dedicated zip code field. **Files:** `apps/web/components/calculator/step1-property-details.tsx` (add zip code input), `packages/database/src/types.ts` (may need to add zipCode field to calculations table), `packages/calculations/src/types.ts:CalculationInputs` (add zipCode field), `apps/web/lib/validation/calculator-schema.ts` (add zip code validation). **Solution:** Add zipCode field to CalculationInputs type, add validation (5-digit or 5+4 format), add InputField component to Step 1 after address field, ensure it's saved in localStorage and included in calculations table when saving to Supabase.
